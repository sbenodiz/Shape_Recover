% This function takes a grayscale image variable u and gives its derivative
% The derivative is the forward x-derivative,
% i.e. we try to approximate the derivative with (u(y+h)-u(y))/h
% but note that the y-axis is taken going to the right 
% the origin is at the top left corner.
% and the distance between the two pixels, h, is taken as 1-unit
% Some people like to take the distance h=1/M for square images where M is the dimension of the image.
